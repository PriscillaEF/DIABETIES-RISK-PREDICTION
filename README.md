# Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project develops an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict diabetes risk using clinical and demographic data.

## Project Workflow
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Baseline Modeling
- Advanced Modeling with XGBoost
- Hyperparameter Optimization
- Model Evaluation and Interpretation

## Key Results
- XGBoost achieved the best overall performance.
- Blood Glucose Level and HbA1c Level were the strongest predictors.
- The model demonstrates potential for early diabetes risk screening.

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- matplotlib, seaborn
